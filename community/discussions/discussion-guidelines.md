‚ùå **Claims of guaranteed accuracy** or infallibility
‚ùå **Suggestions to bypass** expert validation requirements
‚ùå **Attacks on individuals** or unprofessional conduct
‚ùå **Sharing of proprietary information** without permission

### Professional Responsibility
- ‚úÖ **Maintain expertise boundaries** - only discuss domains where you have professional competence
- ‚úÖ **Preserve uncertainty** - never overstate confidence levels
- ‚úÖ **Respect stakeholders** - consider impact on vulnerable populations
- ‚úÖ **Document limitations** - share what didn't work as well as successes
- ‚úÖ **Support validation** - encourage rather than discourage expert oversight

## üìã Discussion Quality Standards
