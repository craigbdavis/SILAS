# SILAS Multi-Agent Research Framework v3.2

**Systematic Insight through Linkage Assessment Suite**  
*Five-Agent Architecture with Edge-Set Attention for Bias-Resistant Graph Analysis*

## 🎯 Purpose

SILAS is an educational framework designed to help domain experts use AI as a **force multiplier** for professional analysis while maintaining rigorous bias detection and uncertainty calibration. It addresses the critical challenge of AI overconfidence in professional contexts through systematic multi-perspective evaluation.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

SILAS implements a five-agent system that treats information domains as graphs and analyzes connection quality through attention-based mechanisms:

## 🔬 Core Innovation: Edge-Set Attention (ESA)

SILAS v3.2 incorporates validated attention mechanisms that:
- **Focus evaluation** on meaningful connections while filtering spurious relationships
- **Scale linearly** with memory requirements for complex analysis
- **Enhance bias resistance** through attention masking of weak linkages
- **Improve calibration** of confidence levels to evidence quality

## ?? Quick Start

**SILAS is an LLM framework that can be deployed within Claude in two ways:**
1. **For multiple chats:** Upload it as project knowledge (available across all conversations in that project)
2. **For a single chat:** Use the document upload button ('+') to attach it to one specific conversation

### Basic Usage
```
User: "SILAS: [your analysis question]"
→ Automatic deployment of appropriate agents based on complexity
→ Multi-perspective analysis with bias detection
→ Integrated synthesis with uncertainty bounds
→ Calibration status and reliability metrics
```

### Agent Configuration
```bash
SILAS: paradigm only           # Boundary setting only
SILAS: single effector empirical  # Focus on evidence analysis
SILAS: adversarial focus       # Enhanced challenge mode
SILAS: comprehensive analysis  # Full 15-20 minute assessment
```
