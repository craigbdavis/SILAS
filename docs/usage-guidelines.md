# SILAS Professional Usage Guidelines

## Overview

SILAS is designed as an **educational framework** for domain experts to systematically explore AI-augmented analysis while maintaining rigorous validation standards. This guide provides practical instructions for responsible implementation.

## üéØ Framework Purpose

SILAS serves as a **force multiplier for human expertise**, not a replacement for professional judgment. It helps domain experts:
- Systematically explore multiple perspectives
- Identify potential blind spots in analysis
- Structure comprehensive assessments
- Maintain rigorous uncertainty acknowledgment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Prerequisites

### Required Qualifications
- **Domain expertise** to validate outputs in your field
- **Professional experience** with analytical methodologies
- **Validation capabilities** to independently verify key claims
- **Understanding** of AI limitations and bias patterns

### Unsuitable Applications
- **Direct decision-making** without expert oversight
- **Production systems** or automated workflows
- **Critical decisions** where errors have significant consequences
- **Areas outside your expertise** without expert consultation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Preparation Checklist

**Before Your First SILAS Session:**
- [ ] Clearly define your area of expertise
- [ ] Identify specific validation methods you'll use
- [ ] Set appropriate stakes (educational/exploratory only)
- [ ] Prepare to document any limitations or uncertainties
- [ ] Review current ESA calibration status

### 2. Environment Setup

**For Claude Projects:**
1. Upload SILAS framework document to project knowledge
2. Ensure framework is available across conversations
3. Test activation with simple query

**For Single Conversations:**
1. Upload framework document using '+' button
2. Verify successful upload in conversation
3. Begin with activation test

### 3. Activation Test
```

```

## üîß Operational Protocol

### Basic Activation
```
User: "SILAS: [your analysis question]"
```

### Agent Configuration Options

**Rapid Assessment (5-7 minutes):**
```
SILAS: paradigm only - [question]

```

**Standard Assessment (8-12 minutes):**
```
SILAS: [question]  # Default comprehensive analysis
```

**Deep Assessment (12-20 minutes):**
```

### For Policy Analysts

**Recommended Uses:**
- Multi-stakeholder impact assessment
- Policy alternative evaluation
- Implementation barrier identification
- Ethical framework integration

**Validation Approach:**
```
1. Verify stakeholder analysis through direct engagement
2. Cross-check policy impacts through expert consultation
3. Validate implementation assessments through precedent analysis
4. Test ethical evaluations through diverse perspective integration
```

**Institutional Requirements:**
- Follow organizational AI usage policies
- Document analytical methodology completely
- Maintain audit trail for validation steps
- Include expert review requirements in recommendations

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance Framework

### Real-Time Monitoring

**During SILAS Analysis:**
1. **Monitor ESA calibration status** - watch for yellow/red warnings
2. **Cross-reference key claims** - independently verify major findings
3. **Document assumptions** - note inputs that might affect analysis
4. **Assess confidence calibration** - ensure uncertainty matches evidence quality

**Red Flag Indicators:**
- Overconfident conclusions given evidence quality
- Recommendations outside your area of expertise
- Systematic dismissal of contradictory evidence
- Implementation advice without adequate risk assessment

### Post-Analysis Validation

**Systematic Validation Protocol:**
```
1. Source Verification
   ‚ñ° Check primary sources independently
   ‚ñ° Verify citations and references
   ‚ñ° Assess source credibility and bias

2. Methodological Review
   ‚ñ° Evaluate analytical approaches used
   ‚ñ° Check for methodological soundness
   ‚ñ° Identify potential bias sources

3. Logic Validation
   ‚ñ° Trace reasoning chains for consistency
   ‚ñ° Check for logical fallacies
   ‚ñ° Verify evidence-conclusion connections

4. Uncertainty Calibration
   ‚ñ° Assess confidence level appropriateness
   ‚ñ° Check uncertainty acknowledgment adequacy
   ‚ñ° Verify risk assessment completeness

5. Professional Standards
   ‚ñ° Confirm adherence to domain best practices
   ‚ñ° Check ethical consideration adequacy
   ‚ñ° Verify stakeholder impact assessment
```

### Documentation Requirements

**Minimum Documentation:**
- AI assistance acknowledgment
- Validation methodology used
- Key uncertainties and limitations
- Expert consultation recommendations
- ESA calibration status during analysis

**Professional Documentation:**
- Complete audit trail of validation steps
- Independent verification results
- Confidence calibration assessment
- Risk mitigation strategies implemented

- **Authority Bias**: Unquestioned deference to expert opinions
- **Selection Bias**: Systematic omission of contradictory evidence

**Mitigation Strategies:**
```
1. Actively seek contradictory evidence
2. Use adversarial agent recommendations systematically
3. Cross-validate through multiple independent sources
4. Maintain systematic uncertainty acknowledgment
5. Engage diverse expert perspectives for validation
```
