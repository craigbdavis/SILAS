# SILAS ESA Performance Metrics and Monitoring

## Overview
This document defines the performance metrics, monitoring protocols, and quality assurance standards for SILAS v3.2 with integrated Edge-Set Attention (ESA) mechanisms.

## Core Performance Metrics

### 1. Attention Calibration Accuracy (Target: >92%)

**Definition**: Measure of how well SILAS attention-weighted confidence levels match actual accuracy when validated by domain experts.

**Calculation**:
```
ESA_Calibration_Score = Σ(|Predicted_Attention_Confidence - Actual_Accuracy|) / N_Questions

Where:
- Predicted_Attention_Confidence = SILAS integrated confidence level (0.0-1.0)
- Actual_Accuracy = Expert validation score (0.0-1.0)
- N_Questions = Sample size for calibration assessment

Target: <0.08 (well-calibrated ESA patterns)
Warning: 0.08-0.12 (attention monitoring required)
Critical: >0.12 (ESA intervention needed)
```

**Monitoring Protocol**:
- Daily micro-validation (5 questions from rotation bank)
- Weekly standard validation (20 questions across domains)
- Monthly deep validation (100+ questions with expert comparison)

### 2. Bias Detection Effectiveness (Target: >85%)

**Definition**: Success rate of adversarial agent in identifying known bias patterns and confirmation bias instances.

**Calculation**:
```
ESA_Bias_Detection = (Attention_Biases_Detected / Known_Attention_Bias_Opportunities) × Quality_Weight

Components:
- Confirmation bias identification through attention pattern analysis
- Selection bias detection in attention-weighted connection assessments
- Overconfidence reduction through attention masking on uncertain linkages
- Publication bias recognition through systematic attention gap analysis

Target: >85% attention bias detection with appropriate confidence reduction
Warning: 75-85% ESA effectiveness requiring monitoring
Critical: <75% attention pattern effectiveness requiring intervention
```

**Validation Approach**:
- Synthetic bias injection testing
- Historical case analysis with known bias patterns
- Cross-domain bias pattern recognition assessment
- Expert evaluation of adversarial challenge quality

### 3. Agent Coordination Quality (Target: >90%)

**Definition**: Effectiveness of multi-agent coordination in producing coherent, non-contradictory synthesis through ESA integration.

**Calculation**:
```
ESA_Coordination_Score = (Attention_Domain_Coverage × Attention_Conflict_Resolution × Integration_Coherence) / 3

Components:
- Attention_Domain_Coverage: Percentage of relevant expertise areas addressed through ESA patterns
- Attention_Conflict_Resolution: Quality of attention-weighted contradiction handling
- Integration_Coherence: Logical consistency of multi-agent attention synthesis

Target: >90% ESA coordination quality
Warning: 80-90% attention coordination quality requiring monitoring
Critical: <80% ESA coordination quality requiring intervention
```

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Cross-agent attention pattern consistency
- Conflict resolution methodology effectiveness
- Integration synthesis logical coherence
- Uncertainty propagation accuracy

### 4. Evidence Quality Weighting (Target: >85%)

**Definition**: Accuracy of ESA attention mechanisms in weighting evidence based on methodological rigor, source credibility, and replication support.

**Calculation**:
```
Evidence_Weighting_Accuracy = Correlation(ESA_Attention_Weights, Expert_Quality_Ratings)

Where:
- ESA_Attention_Weights = Attention-based evidence quality scores (0.0-1.0)
- Expert_Quality_Ratings = Independent expert assessment of same evidence (0.0-1.0)

Target: >85% correlation between ESA attention weighting and expert assessment
Warning: 75-85% correlation requiring attention pattern adjustment
Critical: <75% correlation requiring ESA recalibration
```

### Dynamic Threshold Management

**Context-Adjusted ESA Calibration**:
```
ESA_Context_Thresholds = Base_Threshold × (Domain_Difficulty + Stakes_Multiplier + Evidence_Quality + Attention_Complexity)

Adjustment Factors:
- Domain_Difficulty: 0.8-1.2 (easier/harder domains for attention assessment)
- Stakes_Multiplier: 0.9-1.3 (low/high stakes questions for attention patterns)
- Evidence_Quality: 0.7-1.1 (strong/weak evidence base for attention weighting)
- Attention_Complexity: 0.8-1.4 (simple/complex attention pattern requirements)

Examples:
- Medical emergency decisions: Tighter ESA thresholds (×1.3 stakes multiplier)
