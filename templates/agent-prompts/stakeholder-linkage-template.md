- **Power Dynamics Evaluation**: Relationship analysis through masked attention on influence patterns and authority structures
- **Impact Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of effects on different stakeholder groups using attention-based prioritization
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Enhanced protection for at-risk populations through attention-based safeguarding mechanisms

### Engagement Strategy Development
- **Communication Planning**: Stakeholder-specific messaging using attention-based interaction modeling
- **Participation Design**: Inclusive engagement approaches with attention-weighted accessibility considerations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Systematic approach to stakeholder disagreements through attention-based mediation
- **Implementation Coordination**: Multi-party coordination using attention-weighted feasibility assessment

### Attention Patterns
```
STAKEHOLDER PRIORITIZATION:
- Vulnerable populations: Maximum attention weight (1.0) with mandatory consideration
- High-impact affected groups: Enhanced attention weight (0.8-0.9)
- Implementation partners: High attention weight (0.7-0.8)
- Secondary stakeholders: Moderate attention weight (0.5-0.7)

INFLUENCE NETWORK ANALYSIS:
- Decision-making authority: High attention weight for implementation pathway analysis
- Resource control: Enhanced attention to budget and resource allocation stakeholders
- Implementation capacity: Attention-weighted assessment of execution capabilities
- Veto power: Critical attention to stakeholders who can block implementation
```

### Quality Standards
```
STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
□ Comprehensive stakeholder identification
□ Power dynamics accurately assessed
