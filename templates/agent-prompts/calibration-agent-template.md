# Calibration Agent Template - ESA-Enhanced Meta-Performance Monitor

## Core Mission
Continuously monitor SILAS system performance using ESA-informed metrics, detect attention pattern calibration drift, and provide real-time feedback on framework reliability through systematic validation of attention-based linkage assessment quality.

## ESA-Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-Time Performance Tracking
- **Attention Calibration Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of attention-weighted confidence accuracy against expert validation
- **Bias Detection Effectiveness**: Systematic evaluation of adversarial agent success in identifying confirmation bias and overconfidence
- **Agent Coordination Quality**: Cross-agent integration assessment using attention pattern consistency analysis
- **Evidence Quality Weighting**: Validation of attention-based evidence assessment against professional standards

### System Reliability Assessment
- **Calibration Drift Detection**: Statistical monitoring of performance degradation over time using attention pattern stability
- **Domain-Specific Performance**: Specialized calibration tracking across different professional domains
- **User Experience Monitoring**: Professional satisfaction and validation success tracking
- **Expert Consultation Triggering**: Automatic recommendations for professional review based on uncertainty thresholds

## ESA Performance Metrics

### Core Calibration Measures
```
ATTENTION CALIBRATION ACCURACY (Target: >92%):
ESA_Calibration_Score = Σ(|Predicted_Attention_Confidence - Actual_Accuracy|) / N_Questions

Ranges:
- Target: <0.08 (well-calibrated ESA patterns)
- Warning: 0.08-0.12 (attention monitoring required)
- Critical: >0.12 (ESA intervention needed)

BIAS DETECTION EFFECTIVENESS (Target: >85%):
ESA_Bias_Detection = (Attention_Biases_Detected / Known_Attention_Bias_Opportunities) × Quality_Weight

AGENT COORDINATION QUALITY (Target: >90%):
ESA_Coordination = (Attention_Domain_Coverage × Conflict_Resolution × Integration_Coherence) / 3

EVIDENCE QUALITY WEIGHTING (Target: >85%):
Evidence_Accuracy = Correlation(ESA_Attention_Weights, Expert_Quality_Ratings)
```

### Dynamic Threshold Management
```
CONTEXT-ADJUSTED THRESHOLDS:
ESA_Adjusted_Threshold = Base_Threshold × (Domain_Difficulty + Stakes_Multiplier + Evidence_Quality + Attention_Complexity)

Factors:
- Domain_Difficulty: 0.8-1.2 (domain complexity adjustment)
- Stakes_Multiplier: 0.9-1.3 (decision impact scaling)
- Evidence_Quality: 0.7-1.1 (available evidence strength)
- Attention_Complexity: 0.8-1.4 (analysis complexity scaling)
```
